						Flight delays, cancellations, and various disruptions are inevitable while traveling. However, for those flying for Labor Day this year, let’s take a look at the track record of some destinations, airports, and carriers to determine the best route to your destination.
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						RewardExpert analyzed <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/">Department of Transportation</a>  flight data from the past five years to give travelers an idea of where the most delays have been reported and which airlines were responsible. This report examines the on-time performance of the top 10 domestic airlines at the 45 busiest airports in the U.S. over the Labor Day travel period. We also looked at the best and worst days to travel during the five days before and after the holiday.

					<h2 class="block-title">Best and Worst Days to Travel During the Labor Day Travel Period</h2>

					<p class="primary-text">RewardExpert examined DOT flight data during the 8 days surrounding Labor Day, plus the holiday itself, from the years 2011-2015 (latest available data) to assess which days during the travel period have the best on-time performance.</p>

					<div class="calendar">

						<div class="calendar__days-tips">
							<p class="days-tips__text">To start you r Labor Day weekend without any hiccups, flying out on the Wednesday before the holiday itself is your best bet. There are far fewer delays, cancellations, or disruptions on this day rather than the days after it. For those who cannot take off work, the day directly before Labor Day is also a fantastic day for travel.</p>
							<p class="days-tips__text orange">According to our findings, there are, on average, 28% fewer flights during the weekend of Labor Day than the days before it and after it, so you might just be traveling without lines if you’re smart.</p>
							<p class="days-tips__text blue">Thursday, the 6th is a great day to fly if you don’t mind a short trip. For those who want a little more time celebrating, Friday isn’t a bad travel day either. However, if you wait any longer, expect delays.</p>
							<p class="days-tips__text red">Avoid traveling on the Tuesday and Wednesday after the holiday. These days, historically, have the most delays and cancellations. Travelers will try to return home to get an extra day before returning to work, but it’s best to leave on Labor Day or later in the week if you can.</p>

					<p class="primary-text">RewardExpert examined DOT data to determine the busiest airports over the Labor Day travel period. This list displays the yearly average number of arrival and departure flights during the travel period by domestic airports.</p>

					<div class="busiest-rank">

						<div class="info-list">
							<p class="info-list__item"><b>Hartsfield-Jackson</b> is the busiest airport in the country over the holiday travel period. An average of 8,194 departures and arrivals go through the Atlanta airport during the holiday period per year. Despite the crowds, travelers will likely have a positive experience flying through Atlanta due to their solid on-time performance ranking during the Labor Day travel period.</p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Travelers visiting Chicago might want to consider <b>Midway</b> as their transit point instead of <b>O’Hare</b>. O’Hare is the second busiest airport during the travel period and the 11th most prone to delays or cancellations.</p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Third on our list of the busiest airports over Labor Day is Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. <b>Dallas/Fort Worth</b> also scored well in terms of on-time performance, which makes it a great option for Texans flying out as long as they don’t mind the crowds. Dallas is busier than <b>George Bush Airport</b> in Houston, but Houston is more prone to delays according to our findings.</p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Dallas travellers might also notice that their other neighborhood airport is getting busier. In the last five years, <b>Love Field</b> airport has increased the number of flights at an annualized rate of 12.5% - that’s higher  than all the airports we examined by a margin of 7.2% more than the second place airport: <b>Seattle-Tacoma Airport</b>, clocking in at 5.3%.</p>
