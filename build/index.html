						Flight delays, cancellations, and various disruptions are inevitable while traveling. However, for those flying for the Fourth of July this year, let’s take a look at the track record of some cities, airports, and carriers to determine the best route to your destination.
					</p>

					<p class="main-text">
						RewardExpert analyzed <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/">Department of Transportation</a> flight data from the past five years to give travelers an idea of where the most delays have been reported and which airlines were responsible. This report examines the on-time performance of the top 10 domestic airlines at the 45 busiest airports in the U.S. over the Independence Day travel period. We also looked at the best and worst days to travel during the five days before and after the holiday.

					<h2 class="block-title">Best and Worst Days to Travel Over Independence Day</h2>

					<p class="primary-text">RewardExpert examined DOT flight data during the 10 days surrounding Independence Day, plus the holiday itself, from the years 2011-2015 (latest available data) to assess which days during the travel period have the best on-time performance. While the day that the Fourth of July lands on differs each year, we analyzed on-time performance across July Fourths each year. We compared the dates, not the days of the week, and applied it to this year’s holiday period.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="calendar__days-tips">
							<p class="days-tips__text">To catch the fireworks without any issues, flying out on the morning of the holiday itself is your best bet. There are far fewer delays, cancellations, or disruptions on the Fourth of July than the days before it. </p>
							<p class="days-tips__text orange">According to our findings, there are, on average, 15% fewer flights on Independence Day than the day before it, so you might just be traveling without lines if you’re smart. </p>
							<p class="days-tips__text blue">Thursday, the 6th is a great day to fly if you don’t mind a short trip. For those who want a little more time celebrating, Friday isn’t a bad travel day either. However, if you wait any longer, expect delays.</p>
							<p class="days-tips__text red">Avoid traveling on the Friday and Saturday before the holiday. These days, historically, have the most delays and cancellations. The same is true for the following Saturday. Travelers will try to return home 
							to get an extra day before returning to work, but it’s best to leave earlier if you can. </p>

					<h2 class="block-title">The Busiest Airports over the Independence Day Travel Period</h2>

					<p class="primary-text">RewardExpert reviewed historical DOT data to determine the busiest airports over the Independence Day travel period. This list displays the yearly average number of arrival and departure flights during the travel period by domestic airports.</p>

					<div class="busiest-rank">

						<div class="info-list">
							<p class="info-list__item"><b>Hartsfield-Jackson</b> is the busiest airport in the country over the holiday travel period. An average of 20,967 departures and arrivals go through the Atlanta airport during the holiday period per year. Despite the crowds, travelers will likely have a positive experience flying through Atlanta due to their solid on-time performance ranking during the Independence Day travel period.</p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Travelers visiting Chicago might want to consider <b>Midway</b> as their transit point instead of O’Hare. <b>O’Hare</b> is the second busiest airport during the travel period and the fourth most prone to delays or cancellations.</p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Third on our list of the busiest airports over Independence Day is Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. <b>Dallas/Fort Worth</b> also scored well in terms of on-time performance, which make it a great option for Texans flying out as long as they don’t mind the crowds. Dallas is busier than <b>George Bush Airport in Houston</b>, but Houston is more prone to delays according to our findings. </p>
							<p class="info-list__item">Dallas travellers might also notice that their airport is getting busier. In the last five years, <b>Love Field</b>, Dallas’ airport has increased the number of flights at an annualized rate of 8.4% - that’s higher  than all the airports we examined by a margin of 4.8% more than the second place airport: <b>Fort Lauderdale</b>, clocking in at 3.6%.</p>
