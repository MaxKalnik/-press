							<b>NEW YORK, August 9, 2017</b> – <a class="text-box__link" href="https://www.rewardexpert.com">RewardExpert</a> – a web service dedicated to helping people navigate reward programs, airline miles and credit card points – today announced the company is coming out of beta mode with a website relaunch featuring a new line of tools and services that simplify earning and spending credit card and travel rewards. RewardExpert’s new website expands it services to encompass every aspect of a consumer’s rewards management and redemption needs, while remaining cost-free.

They often lack transparency and are riddled with fine print,” says RewardExpert CEO and co-founder Roman Shteyn. “RewardExpert is expanding its scope to demystify rewards programs and empower our users with tools and information to become savvy spenders who can make their money work for them.”
